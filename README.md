# DSA Codings

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) coding exercises from my university lab sessions. These implementations cover fundamental and advanced DSA concepts, including:

- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Binary Search Trees**
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**
- **Heap & Priority Queues**
- **Recursion & Dynamic Programming**

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
Each folder represents a different lab session, containing Java implementations of various DSA problems.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts:** Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository serves as a personal reference for my DSA journey. Feel free to explore and use the code! ðŸš€
